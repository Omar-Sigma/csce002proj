1-You can use the buttons displayed on the screen 
to type a number or anything you want, 
please click the button of the instruction you want 
and it will appear immediately in the entry box.

2-There are buttons for numbers e.g. [ 1, 2, 3, 4,…,] symbols e.g.[ π, e ] 
,mathematical operations e.g. [+, -, x, ÷, !] and marks e.g.[ . , ) , ( ]. 
Click on it’s button and  it will be displayed 
immediately in the entry box on the screen. 

3-To use the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions [sin ,cos, csch, coth,….]  
buttons, click on them: they will be displayed on the screen. 
Then enter the value you want. after you have entered the value 
click on the closing bracket button “ ) “ in order not to cause any errors to occur.

4-To use the logarithmic functions e.g.[log, ln]: to use the natural logarithm 
function, click on the “ln” button then enter the desired value. 
Then click on the closing bracket button  “ ) “ in order 
not to cause any errors to occur. For the log function, 
click on the “log” button, there will be two entry places.  
In the first place to the left enter the 
number you need, then in the second place on the right enter the base.

5-To use roots: for square roots, click on the button  “  √▯ “ 
then enter the value you need, then click on the closing bracket button “ ) “  
in order not to cause any errors to occur. To use any nth root, 
click on the button “ ▯√x “,  there will be two entry places. In 
the first place to the left enter the number you need, 
then in the second place on the right enter the power of the root function.

6-Using powers: If you need to add a power of 2 to your value, 
first enter the value you need then click on the button "x²" and 
it will add the power of 2 to the value you entered immediately. If you want 
to add any other power to your value enter your value first 
then click on the button "x^▯" and write the desired exponent.

7-If you want to clear all what's in the display box, 
click on the button “clr” and everything in the display box will be cleared.

8-If you want to assign variables and save them in the memory for later, 
use the assign section on the top right of the calculator, first choose 
the variable you need then write the value you need to assign in the small 
entry box at it's right.  you can assign many values at the same time. after 
you enter the values click on the “Assign” button at the top of the assign 
section and the entered values will be assigned to the variables in front of them. 
If you want to clear the values you have previously assigned in the assign 
section, click on the button “clear” on the right of the assign section.

9-if you want to write some notes or important rules you may forget you can 
use the notes section in the top middle of the calculator, 
just click on the entry box there and start typing your notes using the 
keyboard and it will be saved. if you want to delete your notes click

11-in order to evaluate your calculations, after you finish 
entering your operation click on the ”=” button to evaluate your answer, 
it will appear immediately in the answer display box above.

12-Click on “dec” after specifying the number of desired decimal places in the adjacent 
field in order to show the result in decimal format.

13-To write any number in any number system and perform operations on it:-
= Hexadecimal: write the number suffixed by 0x. So for example to type the number F: 0xF3
= Octal: write the number suffixed by 0o. So for example to type the number F: 0x71
= Binary: write the number suffixed by 0b. So for example to type the number F: 0x10100
Typing any number in that manner and then clicking equal will convert it to decimal.
You can also write them like this in calculators. For example (0b10)*(0xF)

14-To convert any thing to one of the formats above, 
just type your desired operation and then click on one of the toggle 
buttons (hex, binary, oct) to have the result converted to them.

15-To use degrees, click on the degree toggle button.

16-Use the permutation and combination functions in the same manner
as the nth root. You type the two parameters inside the brackets respectively.
